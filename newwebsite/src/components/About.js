      <p className = 'spaced-top aboutfont' > An enthusiastic, versatile and ever improving software developer with a passion for creating innovative, smart and value delivering software. I pride myself on being a full stack developer, relish in the constant learning and push myself to keep improving by staying abreast of the latest technologies.
          I have spent the last year working in the Fintech industry as a Junior Full Stack Dev where I have loved applying my skills and learning new ones.
      </p>
        <p className= 'spaced-top aboutfont'> When I'm not developing I am spending time with my family which includes my wife, three children, a dog(Icecube) and a cat(Cersei).
        In the little spare time I have left, I love all things Tech, I am a long time gaming fans and love to get out and about either with the dog or fishing up and down banks all over the country.
